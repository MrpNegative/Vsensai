                <h3>Name: Md Rashadul Islam Fuhad</h3>
                <p>Assalamualikum, Myself Fuhad am a  Inter 1st year student. For now, my goal is to finish this course in time with an average of 50+ marks so that I can join SCIC. My goal was to get an average of 60 but some problems came in the way and I had to late submit some assignments. After I submit this assignment I will try to come back to the flow of the course as before. And I plan to use the eid vacation to fill the gap I have.</p>
